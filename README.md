# iOS Clean Architecture with Coordinator pattern

When you decide to use clean architecture in your project, it is very tired create new modules, because you need create at least 5 files for each. Imagine that you need to create 6 modules... I was suffering this problem, and this is the reason why I've created this template. It's very useful for me and I hope that for you too.

## How to install

### Using script (easy)

You should be this output message:
************************************
✅ Xcode🔨 template installed succesfully 👌🏻. Enjoy it 👨🏻‍💻

## How to uninstall

### Using script (easy)
Only need execute this command in terminal:  `sudo swift uninstall.swift`
You should be this output message:

If all it's ok you now could find your template in Xcode.

### Manual
Go to Application folder, browse to the Xcode application icon. Right-click it and choose 'Show Package Contents'. Then browse to:
`Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Application` and add "Module VIP.xctemplate" file. Now you can find your template in Xcode.


## Generated code
This template generates all files that you need to create a new clean module. All generated code is Swift 4.
